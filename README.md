Question 1 -> Sum of Natural Numbers up to N. (V Easy) : 
              Calculate the sum of all natural numbers from 1 to n, where n is a positive integer. Use the formula: 
              Sum=n×(n+1)/2 . 
              Take n as input and output the sum of natural numbers from 1 to n . 
Question 2 -> Count Digits in a Number. (Easy) : 
              Count the total number of digits in a given number n. The number can be a positive integer. For 
              example, for the number 12345, the count of digits is 5. For a number like 900000, the count of digits 
              is 6. 
              Given an integer n, your task is to determine how many digits are present in n. This task will help you 
              practice working with loops, number manipulation, and conditional logic. 
Question 3 -> Function Overloading for Calculating Area. (Medium) 
              Write a program to calculate the area of different shapes using function overloading. Implement 
              overloaded functions to compute the area of a circle, a rectangle, and a triangle.
Question 4 -> Design a C++ program to simulate a banking system using polymorphism. Create a base class 
              Account with a virtual method calculateInterest(). Use the derived classes SavingsAccount and 
              CurrentAccount to implement specific interest calculation logic: 
                • SavingsAccount: Interest = Balance × Rate × Time. 
                • CurrentAccount: No interest, but includes a maintenance fee deduction.
Question 5 -> Hierarchical Inheritance for Employee Management System 
              Create a C++ program to simulate an employee management system using hierarchical inheritance. 
              Design a base class Employee that stores basic details (name, ID, and salary). Create two derived 
              classes: 
                • Manager: Add and calculate bonuses based on performance ratings. 
                • Developer: Add and calculate overtime compensation based on extra hours worked. 
              The program should allow input for both types of employees and display their total earnings.
